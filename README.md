# Swiss food consumption and provenance

# Abstract
The food we eat everyday comes from many places, sometimes places we do not except. In this project we aim to tell a story about what kind of food we are used to eat as Switzerland citizens, where it comes from and what our impact on the agricultural market is. We will start by looking at what the swiss population tends to eat and try to retrace their origin. Then we aim to gather more information about this food like the price, the carbon footprint etc.

# Research questions
- What is the proportion of the imported products composing an average meal in Switzerland? 
- What Switzerland imports the most and how much does it cost to the swiss people ?  
- How much goes to local producers from the cost of an average meal in Switzerland ? 
- Which are the main food providers of Switzerland ? 


# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

 - [Open Food Facts website](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) is an important dataset for our project as the it gives information about origin, ingredients of a product.
- [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics) is also a good support as the  database includes all food and agricultural products imported/exported annually by all the countries in the world.
