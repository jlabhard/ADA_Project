# Swiss food consumption and provenance

## Abstract
The food we eat everyday comes from many places, sometimes places we do not except. In this project we aim to tell a story about what kind of food we are used to eat as swiss citizens, where it comes from and what our impact on the agricultural market is. We will start by looking at what the swiss population tends to eat and try to retrace their origin. Then we aim to gather more information about this food like the price, the carbon footprint etc.

## Research questions
- Analysis of the provenance of the food and agriculture products consumed in Switzerland
- Impact of the globalization on the local production from an economical perspective 
- Analysis of the impact on the environment of the Swiss food consumption 

## Dataset
Here's a list of the datasets and databases we are going to use :

- [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics)
is a high quality dataset containing important statistics like imports,exports,food supply and trade data of each country, detailing a long list of agriculure products and food. 
- [eaternity](https://eaternity.org/foodprint/database) very good database containing an accurate estimation of the food carbon footprint of all major food products. The project provides also an API for querying the database

## Contributions of team members 
The workflow used in the project was chosen in such a way every team member contributes equally to the project by assigning non overlapping tasks and analysis while in the same time collaborate together and hand results to each other. 
Here is a description of the tasks performed by each team member :

- Jonathan Labhard 
  - 
- Olivier Lam :


- Stanislas Jouven:

- Jalel Zghonda :
  - Get in touch with Eaternity team and negotiate a limited access to their database
  - Data augmentation with the CO2 food emissions 
  - Analysis of the Swiss Food carbon footprint, prepare charts and share results to team
