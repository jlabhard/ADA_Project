# Swiss food consumption and provenance

## Abstract
The food we eat everyday comes from many places, sometimes places we do not except. In this project we aim to tell a story about what kind of food we are used to eat as swiss citizens, where it comes from and what our impact on the agricultural market is. We will start by looking at what the swiss population tends to eat and try to retrace their origin. Then we aim to gather more information about this food including the price analysis and impact on the environment 

## Research questions
- Analysis of the provenance of the food and agriculture products consumed in Switzerland
- Impact of the globalization on the local production from an economical perspective 
- Analysis of the impact on the environment of the Swiss food consumption 

## Dataset
Here's a list of the datasets and databases we are going to use :

- [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics)
is a high quality dataset containing important statistics like imports,exports,food supply and trade data of each country, detailing a long list of agriculure products and food. 
- [eaternity](https://eaternity.org/foodprint/database) very good database containing an accurate estimation of the food carbon footprint of all major food products. The project provides also an API for querying the database

## Contributions of team members 
The workflow used in the project was chosen in such a way every team member contributes equally to the project by assigning non overlapping tasks and analysis while in the same time collaborate together and hand results to each other. 
Here is a description of the tasks performed by each team member :

- Stanislas Jouven :
  - Analysis of the producer prices of the different agriculture products 
  - Team Management and provided motivation
  - Prepared line plots and provided support for the data story 
  
  
- Olivier Lam :
  - Analysis of the food composition and characteristics 
  - Provided quick html/JS knowledge transfer to the team
  - Contributed in editing the data story website

- Jonathan Labhard:
  - Analysis of the food provenance
  - Support the team by providing filtered pickle files containing specific aggregated data
  - Prepare the provenance map in the data story

- Jalel Zghonda :
  - Communication and negotiation with the Eaternity team for their database knowledge 
  - Data augmentation with the CO2 food emissions 
  - Analysis of the Swiss Food carbon footprint, prepare charts and share results to team
  
 ## Presentation and poster preparation
 - Team meeting in week 1 of 2020 
 - Refurbish the individual plots and charts of each team member
 - Prepare a pitch/slides (all team members)
 - Practice the pitch and the presentation in front of the team (Jonathan Labhard)
