# Swiss food consumption and provenance

## Abstract
The food we eat everyday comes from many places, sometimes places we do not except. In this project we aim to tell a story about what kind of food we are used to eat as Swiss citizens, where it comes from and what our impact on the agricultural market is. We will start by looking at what the swiss population tends to eat and try to retrace their origin. Then we aim to gather more information about this food like the price, the carbon footprint etc.

## Research questions
- Analysis of the provenance of the food and agriculture products consumed in Switzerland? 
- Impact of the globalization on the local production? 
- How does the choice of the import sources impact the food carbon footprint of Switzerland ?  

## Dataset
Here's a list of the datasets and databases we are going to use :

- [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics)
is a high quality dataset containing important statistics like imports,exports,food supply and trade data of each country, detailing a long list of agriculure products and food. 
- [eaternity](https://eaternity.org/foodprint/database) very good database containing an accurate estimation of the food carbon footprint of all major food products. The project provides also an API for querying the database

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 3
- Save the needed subsets into pickle files and deploy them to all team members
- Organize a meeting and assign non overlapping tasks to all team members
- Define the needed plots and the visualization and try to find a way to get to them 
- Convince Manuel from Eaternity to provide support for the project and get cited in return.  
- Augment the relevant datasets with the carbon emission data of the food 
- Plan a long meetings for designing the data story
- Start working on the final document that will be published 
- Start a draft of the report 

## Questions for TAs
- No questions for now
